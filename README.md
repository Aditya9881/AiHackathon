Property Price Prediction

This project highlights how machine learning can be applied to real estate data to predict property prices, providing valuable insights to buyers, sellers, and agents. It combines data generation, preprocessing, model training, and interactive user features to create a robust system for property price estimation. The modelâ€™s predictions are complemented by visualizations and insights, making it a powerful tool for real estate analysis.
